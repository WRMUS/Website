        <br>
        In the U.S., the State offers us a limited set of responses to sexual violence: the criminal legal system for perpetrators, and professional anti-violence services for survivors. Both of these are largely individualized responses to what is seen as an individual problem. Options like therapy and women’ s shelters for survivors and restraining orders and pressing charges against perpetrators often <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 3)">exclude political solutions</span> that could organize collective change and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 4)">confront the roots of sexual and gender-based violence</span>.

        When sexual violence is seen as the immoral actions of a few evil monsters, the common response is to cast those who cause harm out of society. But this view leaves us in a bind when violence happens among our friends and family, as we are left with the choice to either <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 13)">demonize or minimize</span> what perpetrators do.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many people minimize or even deny sexual violence because it can be <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 14)">too painful to recognize acts of harm committed by those we love</span> and consider ‘ good people.’
        On the other hand, demonizing people who cause harm often plays out along histories of oppression. People of color, and African-Americans in particular, have long been represented by dominant society as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 15)">monsters or criminals</span>, queer and trans people <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 16)">as sexual predators</span>, and people with disabilities and neurological diversity as less than human.

        In the face of these moral economies of good & bad guy, victim & perpetrator, a transformative approach offers a different principle that unites us and makes us human: <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 20)">everyone both experiences and causes harm</span> (both interpersonal violence and structural oppression) to varying degrees in their lives. While structural positioning impacts how vulnerability to harm or be harmed is distributed, this still gives us a humble starting point for what we share.

        carceral : blame and punishment
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Because sexual violence is seen as an individual, moral issue, responsibility is framed as guilt or blame. The model of responsibility on which the prison industrial complex and other carceral institutions of society are built is what philosopher Iris Marion Young calls a “liability model” of responsibility, in which I am responsible for actions that I voluntarily, knowingly, and intentionally cause. This model is built on the ‘ sovereign’ subject of liberalist theory. It assumes an atomistic, autonomous individual who has free choice and whose intentions, actions, and their consequences are fully transparent to him (I say ‘ him’  because this free subject has traditionally been male). This concept of the human focuses more on the self and ignores the interpersonal relationships and social structures that co-create the self.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this model, responsibility is like debt: I create a debt by violating the rights of others, which must be repaid by denying my rights in proportion to my wrongdoing. These are my ‘ just deserts,’  fulfilled through retributive punishment (‘ an eye for an eye’ ). ‘ Taking account’  works like a math equation that determines who owns which misdeeds. Human life is framed in terms of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 95)">accounting and property, reminiscent of slavery</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, my wrongdoings are seen as the result of my moral failures. My actions say something about my deepest character and ability to govern myself. This “real self” view of our actions is often popularly understood in our climate of retributive sentiment as moral essentialism. From an essentialist perspective, committing sexual violence signals something morally wrong and thus <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 381)">difficult or impossible to change about a person</span>. This feeds attitudes that certain people (or groups of people) are inherently criminal and cultivates punitive feelings of guilt and shame in people who cause harm. Those feelings often keep people who cause harm focused on themselves (their intentions, deepest character, or moral status) and prevents them from seeing and responding to those who they have harmed.

      <div class="title title-font unitalic">
        transformative : accountability
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        In contrast, a community accountability model starts with a radically different concept of the subject: socially constructed both within relationships of intimacy and recognition and through relationships of power and oppression. Drawing on indigenous, disability, feminist, and postcolonial theories, it sees individuals as shaped by different levels of intersubjectivity, ranging from family to community to social structures.
        Violence does not originate in any one of those levels of inter subjectivity but is an interaction between all of them, as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 39)">violence at interpersonal levels is enabled and reinforced by violence at structural and State levels</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this model, responsibility for causing harm is less a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 95)">mathematical calculation of ‘taking account’</span>, than it is a mode of response to my relations with others, relations which constitute me and which I cannot fully master. Harm is understood not primarily as a violation of rights, but of particular human relationships. This calls for a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 382)">cycle of prevention, reparation, and transformation</span> in order to address <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 39)">those relationships</span> and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 40)">behaviors</span>.  Rather than the application of universal laws to a particular case, accountability is <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 41)">tailored to the specifics</span> of the situation and particular needs: <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 42)">“contextual rather than prescriptive”</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this form of response, I give <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 43)">an account of myself</span> and my actions, a narrative, an explanation. My account of myself is also always an account of all the larger forces that shaped me, but being a social creature <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 44)">doesn’ t limit my agency or take away my ability to be responsible</span>. Rather, being a social creature is the basis of my agency and the grounds of my response. In fact, responsibility as responding is only possible because I am connected to and shaped by others around me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whereas the moral essentialist view would tell me my violent behavior says that my character is inherently bad, in a transformative approach, becoming aware of my socialization allows me to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 45)">make choices</span> that build my agency and self-determination: to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 46)">re-shape myself</span> and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 47)">re-author my story</span>. It also allows me to focus less on intent and more on effect and turn towards those I have harmed to cultivate empathy and response to them.

        carceral : security
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        The previous section explains why a carceral logic of blame and punishment can’ t end violence because it neither encourages individuals causing harm to change their behavior nor does it address the underlying conditions that promote violence. But that carceral logic doesn’ t even benefit those it claims to protect: survivors.
        <br>
        <br>
        When violence is individualized in a moral economy of ‘good victims’  and ‘bad perpetrators’, ‘victims’  are often portrayed as weak, helpless, and vulnerable. They need rescuing by powerful outsiders, be it service professionals or cops.  Starting in the 1980s, as the anti-violence movement became more mainstream and institutionalized, it often <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 48)">turned to the State</span> for protection.
        <br>
        <br>
        But a relationship of protection can nevertheless be one of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 49)">domination, even if cloaked in the language of security</span>. The security State has two faces which correspond to two faces of masculine power. One is associated with male violence and dominance turned outwards towards what are seen as ‘enemies’, in the form of prisons and policing. The other is a face of ‘good men’  who protect the sanctity of white, heteronormative, middle and upper class women and the feminized private sphere, a ‘hearth’  they can come home to.
        <br>
        <br>
        This security model has racist and colonial qualities as well. When security and protection has been offered to women of color by State agents, it has often been done as if those women need ‘ saving’  from their own communities, pathologizing communities of color and heroizing white saviors who parachute in. In tune with increased privatization of
        social welfare functions of the State, security is seen as a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 50)">commodity or service</span> that only a ‘powerful outsider’  can provide, for a price.

    <div class="question-content" id="Transformative Approach: Safety">
      <div class="title title-font unitalic">
        transformative : safety
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        But what if survivors, and their surrounding communities, are seen as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 51)">powerful and full of resources</span>, rather than as ‘victims’ ? Rather than outsourcing protection, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 52)">safety is “self-generated”</span> by recognizing and building survivors’  and their allies’  own capacities to withstand and resist violence and oppression. When safety is understood not as avoidance but engagement with causes of harm, survivors can become advocates and activists, not only for themselves but also for wider social change.
        However, such empowerment calls upon us to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 53)">lose our attachment to a ‘victim’  label</span>, and the forms of both security and dependency it may have made possible for us, in favor of a view of ourselves with agency.
        <br>
        <br>
        But social change requires risk, a word not often paired with the idea of safety and certainly the inverse of protection.  However, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 54)">generationFIVE points out that social change necessarily requires risks</span>.  With enough support, a survivor may decide to take a short-term individual risk by making their case public, because they see it as a valuable efforts towards the long-term safety not only for themselves but for other future partners of their abuser.  Or a survivor may decide to take on an active role in a process and advocate for herself, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 96)">accepting the risks of exposure, backlash, or gossip</span>, but also offering her the chance to have her truth heard.  Of course, such risks must be chosen by those potentially most affected and made with careful planning to limit negative consequences.
