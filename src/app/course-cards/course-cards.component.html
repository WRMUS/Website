        This research project began as an informal exchange betn activists and organizers working on community accountability & transformative justice (CA-TJ) responses to sexual violence. Our fledglingThis research project began as an informal exchange between organizers working on community accountability & transformative justice (here abbreviated as CA-TJ) responses to sexual violence. Our fledgling <a href="https://www.transformativejustice.eu/en/">transformative justice collective in Berlin, Germany</a> was geographically far from the mothership of CA-TJ thought and organizing in the U.S. Dialoguing with those who had created and propelled this work became a mode of both giving and taking account of one another.

      <div id="Participatory Action Research" class="title">Participatory Action Research</div>
      <div class="question">
        That informal exchange expanded into a participatory research project in 2013 as the foundations of my Master’s thesis. The research explored the theoretical underpinnings of CA-TJ, like what does it mean to be <span style="font-style: italic;">accountable</span> after all? And who or what is <span style="font-style: italic;">a community?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.incite-national.org/page/participatory-action-research">Participatory action research</a> is an approach that understands all participants in a research process to be co-creators of the project’s goals, methods, and outcomes. In my interviews, our dialogues offered an opportunity to collectively think through questions emerging out of our respective practices. Interview partners shared organizational materials, connected me with other activists, and even read parts of my thesis.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, this project was not fully participatory from start to finish. Participants were scattered across the U.S. and Canada, so we could not meet at one table and political work put limits on time. The research took the shape of a net weaving from one node of organizing to another, as a set of questions and ideas developed in one conversation was carried into the next. This site allows me to put all those conversations side by side.

        All in all, 15 activist-thinkers (or groups) gave interviews. You can read their full biographies <a routerLink="/detail/Game Changers">here</a>.  I was the primary interviewer, and several were done by comrades in the Transformative Justice Kollektiv Berlin.

        Some of the academic results of this research can be found <a href="https://hu-berlin.academia.edu/MelanieBrazzell">on my academia.edu site</a>. Because many interviewees described the need to archive and document this work, this site was built to amplify the oral histories of the CA-TJ movement.

        Many accounts of CA-TJ work currently out there offer narratives of a single community-based process, following narrative arcs of ups and downs and the interactions between various players as they move through a process.
        <br>
        <br>
        This website approaches CA-TJ work differently: by cutting it vertically rather than horizontally. Rather than looking at full stories, the website gathers several voices and hears what they each have to say about the same general question: What is a community after all? How do we get people to change? Where is the movement headed?
