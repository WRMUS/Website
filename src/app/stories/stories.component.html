                                    treating people as victims in need of external protection via walls and weapons,
                                    collective support empowers survivors to exercise their agency. How can we accompany
                                    those who experience violence along the path to healing, power, and change?

                                    behaviors to prevent future harm. What can those processes look like?

                                    that have been broken through violence, and hold survivors and (if possible) persons
                                    who cause harm within a web of healthy relationships. What are different ways to
