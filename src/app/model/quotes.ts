        tagline: 'Contextual not prescriptive',
        quote: 'We might start from questions like: <strong>What does accountability mean? What does accountability look like? How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything – we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> – what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.'
        + '<br><br>' + 'For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\’s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn\’t possible</strong> – or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.'
        + '<br><br>' + '<strong>This doesn\’t mean that everyone is always satisfied</strong> – sometimes folks don\’t get what they want – or what they want changes – and it can be painful and unfair. But starting from a <strong>contextual, not a prescriptive</strong> understanding of what accountability means and looks like gets us closer to making it in real, if imperfect ways.'

The first year of our work was mostly building relationships, also doing collective structure stuff, but really the bulk of it was building relationships and learning how to have conflict with one another and learning how to trust one another.

And I know that we\'re able to talk about whatever comes up and support each other in all these different ways. I think that when those relationships started feeling solid and falling into place is when doing TJ work actually started to feel possible for me. But I think that <strong>we\'ve always seen relationship-building as not being the precursor to the work but actually being the work itself</strong>. And being the tissue that\'s going to hold the work together.

I just kept on running up against the barriers of what we were able to offer, specifically because my reading of the history of the <strong>movement to end violence against women</strong> in the United States is that it\'s been <strong>co-opted by the criminal legal system</strong>. To do that work in the U.S. now, especially as a 501c3 or as a non-profit, it feels there are all these ways that it\'s increasingly necessary to be involved with the police and with child welfare and all of those things.'

Maybe you can have <strong>individualized counseling</strong> for a certain period of time but that\'s really the only intervention that we have. Either we can take it to trial or we can do this one-on-one step with you, but there\'s nothing else that we can do. For so many people who either didn\'t want to or weren\'t able to report a case to the police, they were like, "What do you mean, that\'s all you can do? You\'re a sexual violence organization, why can you not offer anything else?"'

So even the women for whom everything went as it was supposed to and they talked to the police and went to the hospital and they were able to get a trial and they had a court date, <strong>even those women were not saying that they felt healing or justice or restoration or power</strong> or anything that our rhetoric was telling them that they would get in that process.

So I would hear from people, \'This person assaulted me, but he\'s my husband and I love him and I don\'t want him to go to jail.\' Or, \'My dad abused me, but it\'s complicated, like I still care about him.\' And the way that I was trained to respond to those feelings was \'You\'re delusional\', \'He hurt you, he\'s in the wrong, the appropriate feeling for you to have is anger and to want revenge and retribution and whatever.\' I think in later years of working there, I remember hearing that so much and just being so trained to shut it down, that that\'s something that sticks with me around <strong>people\'s visions of justice</strong>, that they <strong>are actually so different from the kinds of justice that we\'re trained to shovel them into</strong>.'

It\'s really tough, and can be very frustrating. As I said before, it\'s usually very difficult to communicate with someone that what they have done has upset someone else, especially if they associate themselves with feminism or fights against general, theorised oppression. What occurs very often is that <strong>people involved with a lot of activism find it very difficult to admit to their own destructive or insensitive (or violent or abusive) behaviour</strong>. So that is the initial challenge, and I am still trying to find a nice way to say \"This person feels that you\'re a perpetrator.\" <strong>No matter how its communicated, there is usually a pretty aggressive reaction.</strong>'

If I know something about their lives, I equate it to a situation where they may feel like a victim, like if they are riding a bike, and a car driver cuts them off... I know this sounds trivial and simplistic, but sometimes it has to be an <strong>external example that doesn\'t threaten people, which then you bring back to a real situation of violence, where the stakes are higher, and then people start to understand the feeling of having less power in a dynamic</strong>. Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps. Of course, people usually believe they are acting to the best of their knowledge and ability, and to explain to them that there was an oppressive or abusive result regardless of this, can be really difficult. Sometimes, people immediately recognise the situation and are really sorry, which cuts out that step.'

That\'s something that we think is valuable and does dovetail with what we do, but <strong>we\'re there to challenge people and get them thinking on the political side of it, but we\'re not there to solve any of the behavioral problems</strong> that they might have. That is something better suited to a therapist. We can only do so much on that end, you know.'
        + '<br><br>' +'Thinking about it as <strong>political education versus more serious behavioral offenses is like making the distinction between assault and abuse</strong>. Because we tend to, in a lot of documents, tend to interchange them or lump them together, because so often sexual assault happens in an abusive relationship. But they are often different. There can be someone who sexually assaults somebody once or a couple of time because they just don\'t understand somebody else\'s boundaries and why that\'s important. And I think a lot of education can go really far to help that.'
        + '<br><br>' +'But then you\'ve got somebody who may only sexually assault somebody once but they\'re emotionally abusive and that\'s long-term. We can try to address those behaviors but it can be kind of difficult to have politics change those behaviors, to just kinda say "Oh, read these zines."'
        + '<br><br>' +'For instance, we can talk to someone about their harm and examine issues of consent and how being intoxicated affects your ability to jugde other people\'s boundaries, but it\'s <strong>beyond our scope to significantly deal with somebody\'s issues with substance abuse</strong>.'
        + '<br><br>' +'So that\'s something that I\'ve been thinking about more in terms of dealing with people, just <strong>drawing that line</strong>. This helps us deal with the scope of what we can do. [...] Some people have a pattern of evading accountability in their lives, through these really deep learned behaviors.

If you are in the same world [as Support New York], you have a better chance because people have an idea of what we do and know and trust us. People causing harm understand that <strong>we are a better alternative than dealing with social pressure, than the community being hostile to them</strong>, and to all those other things. The fact that the survivor chose not to use the state is a show of good faith.

You also risk a bigger divide between what the person says in the space of the process and what they do in the world.

People were like, "Oh well, you\'re in an accountability process so what does that say about you. You\'re a fuck up, whatever." When somebody\'s trying really hard for themselves to change but their public image doesn\'t change, it\'s hard, because we can\'t really give any guarantees that once they go through the process, they are just going to be accepted back with people.'

It\'s limbo in that, in one case I know, it suspended critique of the person, because he could respond to any criticism by saying, \'Oh, I\'m in a process.\' <strong>When the process was put on hold because of problems, so was the critique of that person</strong>.

That\'s something I\'d like to see be more acceptable and common. But I think that\'s really hard because some people are important: "Oh I have to do this work to." But I mean, that work does really get in the way of a process with people who are already emotionally overwhelmed and busy.'

Do we just drop this person? \'Well that\'s not what we [Support New York] are asking for. I keep thinking of Julian Assange, because I see so much of that: people <strong>lionizing a person as such a valuable activist, who\'s "done so much for us," and therefore erasing everything that they\'ve done that\'s harmful</strong>.'
        + '<br><br>' + 'People are not really able to have a parallel analysis. It\'s hard for people around the person causing harm to understand how <strong>people are more complicated than just really, really good or really, really bad</strong>. While the work from a person causing harm might be valuable for an organization, people\'s lives and safety and sexual health are also valuable, and that person has done helpful and harmful things.'
        + '<\/br>' + 'Plus, we hear the request from survivors a lot to <strong>get people causing harm out of mentorship roles</strong>, where they are in situations of power or meeting new people who they might be educating, etc. Some people in the organization are like, \'Why is this person being punished, why can\'t they do the work they do?\' and We say, \'Why don\'t they do the work without mentoring people?\''
        + '<br><br>' + 'Then there\'s a whole other conversation about <strong>male work and female work</strong>. It\'s so gendered, who becomes the public face of a group and who gets to do certain \'important\' work and who ends up doing the work that\'s necessary to sustain things and keep it together, the \'shit\' that isn\'t public and respectable: standing at the doorway greeting everybody at the party, tabling, chopping the fucking onions, right? There are things you can do to still get work done and be more behind the scenes. We try to <strong>challenge persons causing harm who want to stay involved in their political work to fulfill the less public and getting-all-the-back-patting roles</strong>. For us, it\'s like "Why don\'t they find a way to do the work a little more behind scenes, why don\'t they find a way to be more supportive?" Because in general, they need to be more supportive.'

                    quote: '“A Zero to a Thousand to Six” is a model for engaging people to talk about accountability. <strong>A Zero to a Thousand to Six is a spectrum of the degree of wrongdoing.</strong> A frequent problem with accountability is that there is a <strong>gap between the degree of the wrongdoing</strong> and the degree of <strong>how the person who perpetrated it or was victim to it feels. </strong> <br><br> When we commit a hurt, we can take zero responsibility or feel a thousand times responsible for it. We can apologize to the hurt person, saying that we feel bad for doing the “one thousand,” but if the victim answers, “Oh, it was really nothing,” then we are not held accountable. <strong>The spectrum helps identify what we really did, then to take responsibility for it. If we did a “six,” then we should take responsibility for the “six”.</strong> This model works <strong>against the greater social tendency to polarize</strong> when holding someone accountable: <strong>We either let people free or send them to prison.</strong> Instead, we should acknowledge and take responsibility for our actions even when we think they tend to fall somewhere in the gray area.<br><br>Summer Lee & Hediana Utarti, Asian Women’s Shelter <br>“Creating Community, Hope and Change” p. 15-16'
