You know, that kind of very literal sense of: <strong>can we tell each other what\'s going on</strong>. When it comes to community accountability, responding to the spectrum of sexual violence and gendered violence in our culture, that becomes really important to me because <strong>silencing</strong> is such a major factor in sexual violence […] I think that often it is like "Oh, accountability is doing the right thing." But there has to be <strong>communication</strong>, there actually has to be a way that we can <strong>witness and be a record and share</strong> with each other.'

Especially when you\'re talking in any kind of intersectional way, community is a term that is often used pre-maturely. So is there an LGBT community? Is that a queer community? Or not? Since maybe nobody\'s talking about queer in that frame? Is that a community that\'s actually <strong>collectively operational, let alone accountable</strong>, like operational for trans people, really?

        quote: 'We might start from questions like: <strong>What does accountability mean? What does accountability look like? How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything – we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> – what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.'
          + '<br><br>' + 'For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\’s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn\’t possible</strong> – or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.'

Maybe you can have <strong>individualized counseling</strong> for a certain period of time but that\'s really the only intervention that we have. Either we can take it to trial or we can do this one-on-one step with you, but there\'s nothing else that we can do. For so many people who either didn\'t want to or weren\'t able to report a case to the police, they were like, "What do you mean, that\'s all you can do? You\'re a sexual violence organization, why can you not offer anything else?"'

Where there are relationships where trust is present or where there are supportive situations and where people\'s lives are in a place where they can do this work on their own, that\'s when we see it as time to step back. So yeah, I think that\'s our way of saying that obviously <strong>there isn\'t an endpoint to a process or an endpoint of transformation</strong> but I think it can get to a place where <strong>it moves on its own</strong>, or at least that moving it forward is the default rather than this radical, new, outside thing.'

It\'s really tough, and can be very frustrating. As I said before, it\'s usually very difficult to communicate with someone that what they have done has upset someone else, especially if they associate themselves with feminism or fights against general, theorised oppression. What occurs very often is that <strong>people involved with a lot of activism find it very difficult to admit to their own destructive or insensitive (or violent or abusive) behaviour</strong>.

Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps. Of course, people usually believe they are acting to the best of their knowledge and ability, and to explain to them that there was an oppressive or abusive result regardless of this, can be really difficult.

There had to be some common ground for mediation, but both were too emotionally invested to find it themselves, so they asked for mediation.  I currently offer a <strong>mediation support service</strong> in a social centre in London, but I find that people would rather turn to friends that they can trust, rather than someone they have never met before! Which is totally understandable. Especially if they are specifically seeking support that is non- institutional or non-professional.'
          + '<br><br>' + 'But the <strong>next step is figuring out what the survivor wants to happen, what the perpetrator would like to change or act on in light of the circumstances... and every situation is different</strong>. A common resolution is that there is social separation of the two parties, where they arrange to not be at the same events at the same time. Or maybe the perpetrator will be excluded from activities for a period of time. Usually the community supports this by organising around that, (eg. if both are facilitating at a workshop event, etc), but sometimes it\'s a difficult matter of confidentiality, where a community may be neeed to support the outcomes of a survivor\'s requests, but it is part of the request that people don\'t speak of the event, or of the specific details of the incident.'

As usual, <strong>things in practice don\'t pan out as well as they do in theory</strong>, and conflict usually arises out of that, especially when people are missing out on things, eg. events, that they resent missing out on, or resent sacrifices in general that they hadn\'t thought of in beginning the mediation process. So <strong>continual mediation</strong> is necessary to iron out those things. Some things don\'t get resolved, and some requests get ignored, so there are a lot of tense and angry emotions surrounding this process. Another issue is the <strong>reaction or behaviour of the community</strong> surrounding said people. Lots of people will have formed a judgment about a situation, and it is tiring and sometimes futile to remind people not to make decisions about circumstances that they aren\'t knowlegeable about! This results in character judgments, prejudices, gossip, all manner of puerile, high school behaviour, and is very disappointing.'

I know this sounds trivial and simplistic, but sometimes it has to be an <strong>external example that doesn\'t threaten people, which then you bring back to a real situation of violence, where the stakes are higher, and then people start to understand the feeling of having less power in a dynamic</strong>. Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps. Of course, people usually believe they are acting to the best of their knowledge and ability, and to explain to them that there was an oppressive or abusive result regardless of this, can be really difficult.

So <strong>philanthropy is not the enemy</strong>, but there is a way in which we are not having a conversation about money that I think it\’s getting in our way. And <strong>I see, in particular women and queer folks, doing what looks like survival sex with their funders in order to keep the lights on</strong>. And there is no other way to describe it.'

We are unwilling to differentiate roles, or to have different relationships with authority, or imagine even that we can function successfully in a hierarchy if it served a particular strategic purpose, and then change our shape if we needed to do something else. So organizationally I\'ve been thinking about, as <strong>we get clearer and warmer towards authority and power, I think there\'s actually a way in which we become more nimble</strong>.

At the same time, there is our unwillingness to call out one another when we see one another and people who look like us being abusive, our reluctance to call those folks out because we\'ve created this <strong>dichotomy</strong> that you are either good or bad, you are either victim or perpetrator, and since you are a victim, you couldn\'t possibly be perpetrating, even though your behavior is in fact abusive. So <strong>we have locked ourselves into these categories that prevent ourselves from really governing, from really seizing, taking, using, moving with and operating with power</strong>.

Before violence against women got silo\'ed into the anti-rape work and the domestic violence work, and all of it funded by the state.

It started with: <strong>"What would it look like if a different group of people other than the people who have traditionally run the women\'s movement got to define what the issue was, how they would want to respond to it, and got to take action and be the leaders?"</strong> Instead of having the ED of the local organization be the leader. We weren\'t even sure it would be around violence against women at first. It was like, what if a group of younger women got to just define the issues for themselves.

FUFA in its early days took the stance that the <strong>reason there\'s so much violence against young women of color was media images of young women of color</strong>. So they did <strong>media justice work</strong>, which was really cool and powerful to watch. Then they became more interested in <strong>healing organizing</strong> and developing concepts around healing.

So it was something more like a think tank than doing actual actions. We met regularly; it was half white women and half women of color. Very focused on <strong>racial justice</strong>. So if women of color couldn\'t make the meetings, we would cancel them. Trying to reflect on how much the women\'s movement in this country has been dominated by white women and really just shut out the voices of anyone who wasn\'t a middle- or upper-class heterosexual white woman. So we were trying to be really conscious of that. And that group put on a bunch of different workshops for the community and put out this writing piece ["Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence"], that came out of all of that.

That\'s something I\'d like to see be more acceptable and common. But I think that\'s really hard because some people are important: "Oh I have to do this work to." But I mean, that work does really get in the way of a process with people who are already emotionally overwhelmed and busy.'
          + '<br><br>' + 'There\'s a <strong>big struggle when someone is a hero</strong>, because it\'s really hard for organizations to figure out: What do we do? Do we just drop this person? \'Well that\'s not what we [Support New York] are asking for. I keep thinking of Julian Assange, because I see so much of that: people <strong>lionizing a person as such a valuable activist, who\'s "done so much for us," and therefore erasing everything that they\'ve done that\'s harmful</strong>.'
          + '<br><br>' + 'People are not really able to have a parallel analysis. It\'s hard for people around the person causing harm to understand how <strong>people are more complicated than just really, really good or really, really bad</strong>. While the work from a person causing harm might be valuable for an organization, people\'s lives and safety and sexual health are also valuable, and that person has done helpful and harmful things.'
          + '<\/br>' + 'Plus, we hear the request from survivors a lot to <strong>get people causing harm out of mentorship roles</strong>, where they are in situations of power or meeting new people who they might be educating, etc. Some people in the organization are like, \'Why is this person being punished, why can\'t they do the work they do?\' and We say, \'Why don\'t they do the work without mentoring people?\''
          + '<br><br>' + 'Then there\'s a whole other conversation about <strong>male work and female work</strong>. It\'s so gendered, who becomes the public face of a group and who gets to do certain \'important\' work and who ends up doing the work that\'s necessary to sustain things and keep it together, the \'shit\' that isn\'t public and respectable: standing at the doorway greeting everybody at the party, tabling, chopping the fucking onions, right? There are things you can do to still get work done and be more behind the scenes. We try to <strong>challenge persons causing harm who want to stay involved in their political work to fulfill the less public and getting-all-the-back-patting roles</strong>. For us, it\'s like "Why don\'t they find a way to do the work a little more behind scenes, why don\'t they find a way to be more supportive?" Because in general, they need to be more supportive.'

Being able to hold boundaries yourself is important in order to teach people who have harmed how to set boundaries, which is part of the work. Also learning to voice needs is so important: to say what you need, but also leave space for what somebody can give. To leave space for a process to not work.'

        quote: '“A Zero to a Thousand to Six” is a model for engaging people to talk about accountability. <strong>A Zero to a Thousand to Six is a spectrum of the degree of wrongdoing.</strong> A frequent problem with accountability is that there is a <strong>gap between the degree of the wrongdoing</strong> and the degree of <strong>how the person who perpetrated it or was victim to it feels. </strong> <br><br> When we commit a hurt, we can take zero responsibility or feel a thousand times responsible for it. We can apologize to the hurt person, saying that we feel bad for doing the “one thousand,” but if the victim answers, “Oh, it was really nothing,” then we are not held accountable. <strong>The spectrum helps identify what we really did, then to take responsibility for it. If we did a “six,” then we should take responsibility for the “six”.</strong> This model works <strong>against the greater social tendency to polarize</strong> when holding someone accountable: <strong>We either let people free or send them to prison.</strong> Instead, we should acknowledge and take responsibility for our actions even when we think they tend to fall somewhere in the gray area.<br><br>Summer Lee & Hediana Utarti, Asian Women’s Shelter <br>“Creating Community, Hope and Change” p. 15-16'
