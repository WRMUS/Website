How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything – we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> – what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.'
        + '<br><br>' + 'For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\’s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn\’t possible</strong> – or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.'

Maybe you can have <strong>individualized counseling</strong> for a certain period of time but that\'s really the only intervention that we have. Either we can take it to trial or we can do this one-on-one step with you, but there\'s nothing else that we can do.

It\'s really tough, and can be very frustrating. As I said before, it\'s usually very difficult to communicate with someone that what they have done has upset someone else, especially if they associate themselves with feminism or fights against general, theorised oppression. What occurs very often is that <strong>people involved with a lot of activism find it very difficult to admit to their own destructive or insensitive (or violent or abusive) behaviour</strong>. So that is the initial challenge, and I am still trying to find a nice way to say \"This person feels that you\'re a perpetrator.\" <strong>No matter how its communicated, there is usually a pretty aggressive reaction.</strong>'

If I know something about their lives, I equate it to a situation where they may feel like a victim, like if they are riding a bike, and a car driver cuts them off... I know this sounds trivial and simplistic, but sometimes it has to be an <strong>external example that doesn\'t threaten people, which then you bring back to a real situation of violence, where the stakes are higher, and then people start to understand the feeling of having less power in a dynamic</strong>. Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps. Of course, people usually believe they are acting to the best of their knowledge and ability, and to explain to them that there was an oppressive or abusive result regardless of this, can be really difficult. Sometimes, people immediately recognise the situation and are really sorry, which cuts out that step.'

So, if a fight broke out in your space, <strong>what would you do?</strong> If this happened, what would you do? <strong>Many of the businesses would assume they didn\’t have safety strategies, they did but weren\’t explicit to them</strong>. They were not written down, they were just in their head as \‘this is what we did.\’ So we wanted to do that to make it more explicit to them. <strong>We wanted to make sure those strategies included queer and trans folks of color</strong>. We wanted to have them have a sense of when and how violence can erupt, for instance, that you actually have to stop somebody with homophobic or transphobic language, because that will escalate.'

I did that for four years and really quickly became really discouraged and frustrated, by the systems and the lack of transformative approach and the lack of even trying to challenge the systems that we were all navigating. It was just all very problematic.'
                + '<br><br>' + 'And so I became a <strong>community organizer</strong> with the idea of starting a project that would respond to issues of violence against women and girls from an organizing perspective, aimed at systems change rather than providing services alone. So I did organizing for a bunch of years on a pretty wide range of issues and <strong>started Women and Girls Collective Action Network</strong>, which set out to do that work.'

That\'s just not what they say. They say we need more trash cans or tree-trimming or "get those gang bangers off the street" or whatever. These issues aren\'t coming up, so I had questions like – <strong>what would it take for those issues to surface?</strong>What could organizing groups do differently to start to responding to issues that really matter for women and girls, and what could the women\'s movement do differently?'
                + '<br><br>' + 'And then Women and Girls CAN became broader than just community organizing and really delved into <strong>community accountability and transformative justice</strong> and a combination of doing grassroots community organizing work and bringing people together to think through different approaches of trying to end violence against women and girls rather than reacting to it. A lot of it was <strong>looking back at old pieces from the 70s, before things in the U.S. got so state-owned</strong>. Before violence against women got silo\'ed into the anti-rape work and the domestic violence work, and all of it funded by the state. You know, there were other ideas of how to approach all of this, and they just kind of got cast aside. So we went back to some of that, but also tried to <strong>tie it into a much more current understanding of racial justice and oppressions</strong>.'
