It started with: <strong>\"What would it look like if a different group of people other than the people who have traditionally run the women's movement got to define what the issue was, how they would want to respond to it, and got to take action and be the leaders?\"</strong> Instead of having the ED of the local organization be the leader. We weren't even sure it would be around violence against women at first. It was like, what if a group of younger women got to just define the issues for themselves.

It was supposed to be a one year exploratory project.<br><br>What happened was when I met with adult women about it, like professors and members of different organizations, they were like \"This is a good one year exploratory project.

Why are we studying?\"</strong><br><br>It became a 501c3, so we were also part of the non-profit industrial complex. It had several different elements. There was a youth organizing piece called <strong>Females United for Action [FUFA]</strong>, organizing mostly high school students, some college students. FUFA in its early days took the stance that the <strong>reason there's so much violence against young women of color was media images of young women of color</strong>. So they did <strong>media justice work</strong>, which was really cool and powerful to watch. Then they became more interested in <strong>healing organizing</strong> and developing concepts around healing. And FUFA started out as a coalition of organizations, and then added individuals, and kind of changed back and forth: there were organizational members of youth groups and also individual young people.<br><br>FUFA also went through a lot of work around <strong>trans issues</strong>. FUFA at one point got approached by trans young women asking if they could join and then did a series of sessions on learning about trans oppression and shifted its focus. And actually in the last days of Women and Girls CAN, there were some discussions before I left about whether to change the name Women and Girls CAN because some people felt it didn't express being open to trans women and girls.<br><br>The <strong>community accountability group</strong> was a group, 7 or 8 women from all different perspectives, all interested in doing this work, some academic, some organizers, some from a social service perspective, all interested in trying to figure this piece out. So it was something more like a think tank than doing actual actions. We met regularly; it was half white women and half women of color. Very focused on <strong>racial justice</strong>. So if women of color couldn't make the meetings, we would cancel them. Trying to reflect on how much the women's movement in this country has been dominated by white women and really just shut out the voices of anyone who wasn't a middle- or upper-class heterosexual white woman. So we were trying to be really conscious of that. And that group put on a bunch of different workshops for the community and put out this writing piece [\"Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence\"], that came out of all of that.

It is not like folks are necessarily just bad people until they're accountable and unsafe until they're accountable.

Do I need to be close friends with people in order for it to make sense, or does that actually not make sense? Because I walked into this process and I wasn\'t close friends with anyone involved. At first, I was like, "On, this is weird." How can I talk about accountability if I\'m not even close friends with these people? Then it ended up actually making more sense for me to be involved in the end in that way.<br><br>But I\'m still not sure if my <strong>distance</strong> from the person who caused harm and the person who experienced harm was a good thing, or if it actually enabled some sort of sense of leniency. No, not leniency, I don\'t know about leniency, but maybe I was easier to deal with because I wasn\'t so emotionally close to the process, and there are pro\'s and con\'s about that. I was able to walk in and play the <strong>compassionate role</strong>, and it worked because other people were playing the more <strong>critical role</strong>, "Are you actually doing what you say you\'re doing? Are you lying to us? Are you not lying to us?" role. I didn\'t have to do that because there was a need for someone to play this more compassionate role and so it made sense for me to do that.<br><br>I do believe that the person who the process was with stuck with it for so long, even when it wasn\'t going super well for them, partly because of this <strong>fear</strong>. This fear that they would end up being either not welcome in certain spaces in the city or they would lose friends over it and just really not wanting that to happen. So being pretty motivated to do this process and stick with it even when it was super hard.We can really credit some of their friends with ... encouraging them to feel that way is a bad way to put it, cuz it was almost... <strong>it almost felt punitive at times</strong>. I was like "Oh my god, you\'re actually scared of what could happen if this process ended, cuz you have a couple friends who are explicitly not gonna be around if this ends."<br><br>But I mean for me that ended up getting me to reflect on the kind of <strong>power that facilitators of those processes wield</strong>. And being super aware of that being a power dynamic. I ended up feeling super weird about it until we had the big community meeting. Some people brought [that] up in the meeting, they were like [...] "We feel like certain ways that you all have dealt with this process is punitive. And is that what you\'re trying to do?"" And we were like, "No, clearly not." And they were like, "Well, think it through, maybe you could have done it differently. Or maybe you could have done it in this way, or whatever."<br><br>If there are a lot of people in your community who are like "We are going to continue to relate to this person, even though they\'ve been called out, on the basis that their accountability process is going well and they seem to be dealing with it in good faith."

What does accountability look like? How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything - we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> - what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn.

Sometimes it is, but that isn't possible</strong> - or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediate communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care.

Scaffolded by hyperbolic media coverage of child abductions and sexual assaults by strangers, restrictions for convicted child sex offenders continue to escalate. Civil commitment laws, enacted in over a dozen states by 2008 and upheld by the Supreme Court in a 2005 decision, aim to geographically detain and segregate certain categories of sex offenders, indefinitely, after release (Feuer 2005; Davey and Goodnough 2007). In several states, laws have been passed to require surgical or chemical castration for repeat offenders after they have served their sentences so they can avoid civil commitment or achieve a conditional release (Rondeaux 2006).

Criminalizing men who assault their intimate partners, for example, has led to a rise in the incarceration (and deportation) of poor men of color, not a decline in the number of women who are assaulted (Wittner 1998; Sen 1999; Richie 2000).

But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.<br><br>For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\u2019s not.

Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care.

For this group, the problem of persistent gender inequality, as a structural problem, remained at the center of the analytical paradigm that activists remained committed to. <strong>Another group coalesced around a different formation</strong>. Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, <strong>they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy</strong> that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership. This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as \u2018specialists\u2019 who worked with women who experienced male violence. Believing that politically they would be better positioned to compete for public support, the feminist activists in this latter group became counselors, community organizers became project administrators, and advocates became apologists for the system.<br><br>Evidence of the tensions between these two approaches in the anti-violence movement echoed broader feminist debates at the time about social change versus social work and the ideological positions that framed each approach. <strong>Radical, anti-racist feminists argued that power was at the heart of male violence against women and that only through liberation of women would the problem of male violence end.

Interventions based on such models risk colluding with violence they are intended to end.<br><br>At the same time, the <strong>emphasis on restoration assumes the conditions that existed prior to an individual incident of abuse are desirable</strong> and should be restored. This ignores the common lack of rights for children, abuses of power, gender inequality, legacies of slavery and colonization, and other types of violence that pre-date and co-exist with ongoing incidents of violence. As such, these models often focus on the <strong>restoration of the status quo</strong> and ignore the challenge of transforming the conditions of social, economic and political injustice that are the context for, and cause of, violence.<br><br>-generationFIVE: J.

And how it shows up in contemporary images and discourse around women, around whose bodies are valuable, about what value means. It shows up all the time in leadership and human resources work. The notion of <strong>'human capital'</strong> comes from slavery, and yet we use that term as if it were, you know, appropriate. <br><br>[What is accountability?] Maybe it is <strong>common sense, maybe it is capitalism, maybe it is love</strong>, who knows?

This will involve paying attention to the importance of maintaining relationships of trust with safe adults in the child\'s life as well as to managing the relationship between the survivor(s) and the person or people that sexually abused them. This also means putting in place protections from backlash. Survivors, those who are sexually abusive and those who are in relationship with either or both, may likely face such backlash during any process of identifying child sexual abuse. Preventing backlash involves creating a thoughtful process for public naming and disclosure, which include considering issues of confidentiality.<br><br>-generationFIVE: J. Carr, A. Greig, S.

How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything \u2013 we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> \u2013 what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.<br><br>For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\u2019s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn\u2019t possible</strong> \u2013 or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.<br><br><strong>This doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is always satisfied</strong> \u2013 sometimes folks don\u2019t get what they want \u2013 or what they want changes \u2013 and it can be painful and unfair.

Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps.

And so was really able to <strong>see their behavior from another person\u2019s perspective</strong>. And <strong>see not just what their intentions were but what the effects were</strong> and understand that.<br><br>Once you have that <strong>switch</strong>, then caring about that and realizing the effects, that the other people\u2019s experience is really negative, and really wanting to change that.

That's something that we think is valuable and does dovetail with what we do, but <strong>we're there to challenge people and get them thinking on the political side of it, but we're not there to solve any of the behavioral problems</strong> that they might have. That is something better suited to a therapist. We can only do so much on that end, you know.<br><br>Thinking about it as <strong>political education versus more serious behavioral offenses is like making the distinction between assault and abuse</strong>. Because we tend to, in a lot of documents, tend to interchange them or lump them together, because so often sexual assault happens in an abusive relationship. But they are often different. There can be someone who sexually assaults somebody once or a couple of time because they just don't understand somebody else's boundaries and why that's important. And I think a lot of education can go really far to help that.<br><br>But then you've got somebody who may only sexually assault somebody once but they're emotionally abusive and that's long-term. We can try to address those behaviors but it can be kind of difficult to have politics change those behaviors, to just kinda say \"Oh, read these zines.\"<br><br>For instance, we can talk to someone about their harm and examine issues of consent and how being intoxicated affects your ability to jugde other people's boundaries, but it's <strong>beyond our scope to significantly deal with somebody's issues with substance abuse</strong>.<br><br>So that's something that I've been thinking about more in terms of dealing with people, just <strong>drawing that line</strong>. This helps us deal with the scope of what we can do. [...] Some people have a pattern of evading accountability in their lives, through these really deep learned behaviors.

And they came about after dealing with a couple of sexual assaults that happened at this big show there. But they created two separate collectives: one to deal with survivors, and one to deal with perpetuators and accountability. A lot of our work came from going to workshops that they presented. The <strong>"Support" zine</strong> put together by Cindy Crabb has also informed us a lot, but I feel like that had less to do with perpetuators.<br><br>So it was seeing these things around us and seeing <strong>how we could apply it here in New York</strong>. Not really knowing a lot about transformative justice or any of these concepts before it all came together, and being just really happy to find them along the way, like "Oh this is really helpful!" I think now that we\u2019ve become aware of a larger movement and more of the conceptual drive behind it, it\u2019s spurred us to try to be more \u2018on point,\u2019 get more materials together, and share our experiences.'},{tagline:"Survivor designs, we facilitate",quote:"Our work is about facilitating a process, not designing it - that's usually something the survivor does. They're often involved. It's a lot <strong>easier to have a structure around your process if it's guided by a survivor</strong>. People can come in and they can, all of a sudden years down the line, realize that they fucked up and be really, really committed. But [without a survivor] you don't have goals, you don't have people to keep you in check. I think that's what's really important, having a survivor there to <strong>keep the focus, to challenge everyone to keep going and to have the broader narrative</strong>. Otherwise, you're not sure where you're going, what you're trying to get to. Having someone who's saying, \"I want this, this, and this,\" I think it's invaluable for the perpetuator, because they're having to meet someone, somewhere. That's hanging over them."},{tagline:"This isn't my decision",quote:"It becomes almost a philosophical practice to support decisions that a survivor makes and at the same time say, \"Well this is not what I would do.\" It's the idea of saying: \"I don't make this decision, <strong>I would not make this decision, but this isn't my decision</strong>.\" I think that you can support that somebody needed to do actions you don't agree with, and still say, we do this kind of work. People know what I do, and they know that they wouldn't call me to engage in violence towards a perpetuator. As for my moral framework, violence certainly challenges it. But what I do and what I focus on is community accountability and transformative justice. I want to <strong>look long-term</strong> and I want to <strong>make a safer community for everyone</strong> and I want to make the space to get there. So tactically for me, I think that <strong>doing what I do now is more useful towards what I envision than violence</strong>."},{tagline:"Be realistic about good candidates",quote:"As much as you want everyone to be accountable, <strong>you have to be realistic about who's a good candidate and who's committed</strong>.  That's the most important thing.  Being committed isn't just showing up, it isn't just giving lip service to the fact that you are doing a process. <strong>It's coming and being honest and open and challenging yourself</strong>.  That is kind of rare and it's not going to work for everyone.  <strong>Not everyone is going to even try to engage</strong>.<br><br>When you are being honest with what a survivor wants, they want a process.  But sometimes you can't get the other person to come into a process.  It's tricky, and that's why it does work better within community, whatever nebulous sense of community there is.  If you are in the same world [as Support New York], you have a better chance because people have an idea of what we do and know and trust us. People causing harm understand that <strong>we are a better alternative than dealing with social pressure, than the community being hostile to them</strong>, and to all those other things. The fact that the survivor chose not to use the state is a show of good faith. No qualms against survivors who choose to go that route, but if you're choosing to go this route, that demonstrates to the perpetuator: this is certainly a less negative alternative than the state for you, than being totally publicly distrusted, and all these things."},{tagline:"Social pressure",quote:"Most of the people I've worked with have been referred by survivors. In one case, I was working with someone who had an initial meeting with us and was really defensive, like \"Fuck this, I don't want to be put on trial, blah blah blah.\" He didn't follow up and then left town and <strong>came back to New York to find more of a hostile environment</strong> for him. I think he <strong>burned a lot of bridges</strong> with people he'd lived with and started to <strong>realize that there are social consequences to not dealing with this and not being accountable</strong>. So I think that <strong>social pressure</strong> is a really big push for people.<br><br>We're well aware that a lot of people might be driven to come to Support New York through that, the idea of 'clearing their name,' and while I wish they were like, \"I want to be a better person, and heal someone else,\" pressure is still <strong>not the worst way to get someone in</strong>. Because hopefully, through that you can talk to them. You can still do enough work once you get them committed, and they'll build trust within the process. Hopefully the <strong>intentions will change</strong> through the process. I've seen that change in people.<br><br><strong>We let perpetuators invite a silent witness to the first meeting with us</strong>, and why I think it's so useful is because that's a person in the world to check them, that's a <strong>person that they trust who encourages them to go this route</strong>. That's probably your best bet. You can't really trick someone. Maybe you don't have the access to them to convince them to do a process, but if their friends do, people that they trust do, that's really helpful."},{tagline:"Trust and commitment",quote:"<strong>The perpetuator has to trust you. It's really really hard to try to get someone to inadvertently be accountable. They really have to understand that this is an opportunity for them to make a change, be a better, more responsible person</strong>. Having worked on another process where the person causing harm was very resistant, it makes it just very idfficult to get anything to happen.  You also risk a bigger divide between what the person says in the space of the process and what they do in the world. They really have to have this commitment, saying, \"I'm doing this, I'm going through with this.\" They have to show up every week or two weeks or whatever it is. They have to step up and do these things. It's hard to force people to get there."},{tagline:"Perpetuator initiated process?",quote:"I've also had the experience of dealing with some people who were not referred by the survivor, though the survivor had made demands of them. They had met most of the [demands], but then were like \"Well, I feel like these are big issues in my life and I want to have somebody to talk to about it.\" It could just be this particular person, but <strong>it didn't really go very well, actually, and made me wary about people who are self-referred. [...]</strong><br><br>We were like \"OK, yeah, you have these behaviors that you wanna fix, let's work on it.\" But that particular person, when we weren't doing things the way he wanted, he would try to get out of it or be like \"I don't know, this text doesn't apply to me, and blah blah blah.\" <strong>If the perpetuator's the one who initiates the process, then it kind of makes sense that they would feel like they still want the control over it</strong>, you know?<br><br>So we talked about having some kind of exchange with people who are self-referred, like \"Okay, we're gonna come meet with you, even though the survivor doesn't care about it, but you need to do the work to find certain readings, you need to do the work.\" We even talked about barter. Yeah, you do the copying. I think that's important to see this work as <strong>a valuable service that we're offering, and to see it as an opportunity</strong>.

There are things you can do to still get work done and be more behind the scenes. We try to <strong>challenge people causing harm who want to stay involved in their political work to fulfill the less public and getting-all-the-back-patting roles</strong>.

And if that person is more careful with their future dealings - there's no guarantee that anything will be what the survivor needs from that person, and that's totally their legitimate right to never have faith in anything that person does - but <strong>if they are made safer and the community is made safer in any way, it's success</strong>. So I find thinking of it piecemeal is useful. Even <strong>getting people to admit things is useful</strong>. Or getting them to agree not to conduct certain behaviors in the future, even if they aren't willing to engage with different perspectives on what happened or really change. <strong>Checking them to extent that it affects the way they behave in the future</strong> is certainly something really valuable."},{tagline:"Giving cases back to community",quote:"There are a couple processes that were not a hundred percent successful, did not turn out the way I would have love them to.

We don't necessarily have an end point.<br><br>We might hit a point where we say, <strong>\"Okay, this isn't going anywhere.\"</strong> If we feel we're lost. We've also had people who are like, \"No, I'm fine, I'll keep meeting, yeah, let's do this.\" But then it doesn't feel like they are making a lot of progress. We are not just going to keep hammering it in, wasting our time. Rather just be like, <strong>\"Okay, so maybe this isn't the best place for you to deal with this.\"</strong> That's another way of ending it and being a little bit more detailed about what was accomplished there and further points to go.<br><br>But if it just seems like a failure and the person is totally still denying abuse and just doing the same behaviors, then the response is going to be something that becomes more of a <strong>public call-out</strong>.
